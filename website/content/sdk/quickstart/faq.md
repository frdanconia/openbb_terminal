## General

<details><summary>How do I update the OpenBB SDK?</summary>
<p>

With new releases of the OpenBB SDK, it would suffice to use `pip install openbb`. If this doesn't update to the latest version you can include the version number as follows `pip install openbb==2.0.0`. Please find the latest version [here](https://pypi.org/project/openbb/).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Where does the data from the OpenBB SDK come from?</summary>
<p>

The OpenBB platform does not provide any data itself as the platform is a data aggregator that connects to almost a hundred different data providers and APIs to access the data.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>What programs need to be allowed for Windows Firewall?</summary>
<p>

When issues arise regarding Windows Firewall, please allow the following applications through (if not already):

- BranchCache
- Hyper-V
- VcXsrv
- Windows Terminal

From the Windows Security menu, click on the Firewall & Network Protection tab, then click on "Allow an app through firewall". If the applications below are not allowed to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall, change the settings to allow.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>On what Operating Systems can I run OpenBB SDK?</summary>
<p>

The OpenBB Terminal is compatible with Windows, Mac Os and Linux. Check the
[installation guide](/sdk/quickstart/installation) and [requirements outline](/sdk/quickstart/requirements) for more details.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How much hard drive space is required?</summary>
<p>

An installation will use approximately 4GB of space.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How do I launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook for use with the OpenBB SDK?</summary>
<p>

Once the installation is finished via `pip` and you have activated the conda environment, as explained in the [installation guide](/sdk/quickstart/installation) you are able to activate a Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook` or Jupyter Lab with `jupyter lab`. Then, you should be able to use the OpenBB SDK by following along with the [How to use the SDK](/sdk/guides/basics#how-to-use-the-sdk) guide.

## Functionality

<details><summary>What kind of architectural pattern does the OpenBB SDK use?</summary>
<p>

Throughout the entire OpenBB Platform, the [Model-view-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) architectural pattern is used for creating functionality in the terminal.

This is visible in the OpenBB SDK with the addition of `_chart` within functions relating to the `view` portfion of the pattern.

For example the model is displayed with:

```
openbb.economy.ycrv()
```

|     |  Maturity | Rate |
| --: | --------: | ---: |
|   0 | 0.0833333 | 3.93 |
|   1 |      0.25 | 4.34 |
|   2 |       0.5 | 4.61 |
| ... |       ... |  ... |
|   8 |        10 | 3.82 |
|   9 |        20 | 4.13 |
|  10 |        30 | 3.92 |

And the view with:

```
openbb.economy.ycrv_chart()
```

<details><summary>Why is data from today missing when I use the load function?</summary>
<p>

By default, the load function requests end-of-day daily data and is not included until the EOD summary has been published. The current day's data is considered intraday and is loaded when the `interval` argument is present.
