You can find `Docker Desktop` for Windows here: [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### 1.2. Start Docker

Execute the following command:

```bash
docker info
```

If you have something like this, it means you haven't started Docker:

```bash
docker info
Server:
ERROR: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
Is the docker daemon running?
```

Start Docker, this is how the right output looks like:

```bash
docker info
Client:
 Context:    default
 Debug Mode: false

Server:
 Containers: 14
  Running: 2
  Paused: 1
  Stopped: 10
```

### 1.3. Install VcXsrv

To display charts with your container, you need : VcXsrv.

You can download VcXsrv here : [Download VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv)

When running VcXsrv program check the option: `Disable access control`

### 1.4. Pull and run the container

Execute this commands:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/main/build/docker/docker-compose.yaml

docker compose run openbb
```

This will download and run the file: `docker-compose.yaml`

This file contents the settings to pull and run OpenBB Terminal Docker image.

## 2. macOS

### 2.1. Install and run Docker Desktop

Install and run Docker Desktop as describe above in this document.

### 2.2. Install XQuartz

  <p>This section guides you a long to install the OpenBB Terminal via Python. This installation type supports both Windows and Unix systems (Linux + MacOS).</p>

<p>Follow along with the instructions of the video or use the steps below to run the OpenBB Terminal:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDYGmH-bQRk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**NOTE for Windows users:** For Windows users who prefer to use an environment similar to what Linux and macOS users use, we recommend Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL emulates a Linux machine inside your Windows system. If this is the case - jump to the <a href="#installing-wsl-only-for-windows-users">Installing WSL (Only for Windows users)</a> section before proceeding.

### Installing the terminal

These steps are common in all operating systems (Windows with or without WSL, MacOS or Linux).

This project supports Python 3.8 and 3.9. By default, the newly created virtual environment will use Python 3.9.13

Our current recommendation is to use this project with Anaconda's Python distribution - either full [**Anaconda3 Latest**](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [**Miniconda3 Latest**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (recommended). Several features in this project utilize Machine Learning. Machine Learning Python dependencies are optional. For MacOS systems, the "Miniconda3 MacOSX 64-bit" version that works on both Intel and M1 macs is recommended.

**NOTE:** We recommend using `conda` and `poetry` because it just works. You can use other python
distributions and use raw `pip` instead of `poetry` but you will very likely bump into installation
issues.

#### 1. [Install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Miniconda is a python environment and package manager. It is required if you want to
have the dependencies working straight away.

- Go [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links) to find the download for your operating system or use the links below:

  - If you are using macOS [Miniconda for MacOS](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh)
  - If you are using WSL or Linux [Miniconda for Linux](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh)
  - If you are using a Raspberry PI [Miniconda for Raspberry PI](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh)
  - If you are using Windows [Miniconda for Windows](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe).

    **ONLY REQUIRED ON WINDOWS IF NOT USING WSL**, Install/update Microsoft C++ Build Tools from here: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>

    **NOTE for macOS users:** The link above gets you the Intel version of miniconda meaning if you're on an Apple Silicon powered machine you will be using the terminal through Apple's rosetta2 layer. We recommend sticking to this distribution for better compatibility until the dependency developers fully catch up with Apple's transition to Apple Silicon.

- After following the steps, confirm that you have it by opening a terminal and running: `conda -V`. The output should be something along the lines of: `conda 22.9.0`

#### 2. Install CMake

CMake is required by several python modules.

**On Linux or Raspberry Pi:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gcc cmake
```

**On macOS:**

Check if you have homebrew installed by running `brew --version`

If you don't have homebrew installed run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install cmake
```

If you have homebrew installed run:

```bash
brew install cmake
```

**On Windows:**

If you have followed the instructions in step 1 of this guide CMake was installed as a part of you Microsoft C++ Build Tools

#### 3. Install git

```bash
conda install -c anaconda git
```

#### 4. Clone the Project

- Via HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal.git`
- via SSH: `git clone git@github.com:OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal.git`

#### 5. Navigate into the project's folder

```bash
cd OpenBBTerminal/
```

#### 6. Create Environment

You can name the environment whatever you want. Although you could use names such as: `welikethestock`, `thisistheway` or `diamondhands`, we recommend something simple and intuitive like `obb`. This is because this name will be used from now onwards.

Please note, the following setup has been confirmed to work for all OS (including M1) with the standard miniconda distribution. If you are using a different distribution, you will need to install it manually before proceeding.

```bash
conda env create -n obb --file build/conda/conda-3-9-env.yaml
```

Or, to include machine learning type:

```bash
conda env create -n obb --file build/conda/conda-3-9-env-full.yaml
```

Note: Using python 3.10+ can lead to undesirable functionality for certain commands.

#### 7. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
conda activate obb
```

Note: At the end, you can deactivate it with: `conda deactivate`.

#### 8. Install dependencies with poetry

Install the main dependencies with

```bash
poetry install
```

You are good to go with the core of the OpenBB Terminal. To install additional toolkits proceed with the following commands:

To install the Portfolio Optimization Toolkit run:

```bash
poetry install -E optimization
```

To install the Machine Learning Toolkit run:

```bash
poetry install -E prediction
```

To install both the Portfolio Optimization and the Machine Learning Toolkit run:

```bash
poetry install -E all
```

#### 9. You're ready to use the terminal!

Start the terminal by running:

```bash
openbb
```

Or the old-fashioned way:

```bash
python terminal.py
```

**NOTE:** When you close the terminal and re-open it, the only command you need to re-call is `conda activate obb` before you call `openbb` again.

**TROUBLESHOOT:** If you are having troubles with installation, check out the [FAQ page](/terminal/quickstart/faq). You can also reach for help on our [discord](https://discord.gg/Up2QGbMKHY).

## Advanced User Install - Custom installation procedures

By default we advise using `conda` and `poetry` for environment setup and dependency management. Conda ships binaries for packages like `numpy` so these dependencies are not built from source locally by `pip`. Poetry solves the dependency tree in a way that the dependencies of dependencies of dependencies use versions that are compatible with each other.

If you are using a conda environment the `build/conda` folder contains multiple `.yaml` configuration files that you can choose from.

If you are using other python distributions we highly recommend that you use some virtual environment like `virtualenv` or `pyenv` for installing the terminal dependency libraries.

Requirements files that you can find in the project root:

- `requirements.txt` list all the dependencies without Machine Learning libraries
- `requirements-full.txt` list all the dependencies with Machine Learning libraries

You can install them with with pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The dependency tree is solved by poetry.

Note: The libraries specified in the requirements files have been tested and work for the purpose of this project, however, these may be older versions. Hence, it is recommended for the user to set up a virtual python environment prior to installing these. This allows to keep dependencies required by different projects in separate places.

### Installing WSL (Only for Windows users)

If you are using Windows you first you need to install WSL. The process is simple and a tutorial can be found [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/wsl2/). Once you reach the section **Update Linux** on that tutorial, you should have a linux machine installed and can proceed to the next steps.

Since WSL installation is headless by default (i.e., you have only access to a terminal running a linux distribution) you need some extra steps to be able to visualize the charts produced by the terminal (more detailed tutorial [here](https://medium.com/@shaoyenyu/make-matplotlib-works-correctly-with-x-server-in-wsl2-9d9928b4e36a)):

1. Dynamically export the DISPLAY environment variable in WSL2:

   ```bash
   # add to the end of ~/.bashrc file
   export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0
   # source the file
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Download and install [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)
3. When running the program is important to check "Disable access control"

After this, `VcXsrv` should be running successfully and we can proceed to terminal installation.
