## General

<details><summary>Where does the data from the OpenBB Terminal come from?</summary>
<p>

The OpenBB platform does not provide any data itself as the platform is a data aggregator that connects to
almost a hundred different data providers and APIs to access the data.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How do I update my installation to the latest version?</summary>
<p>

The terminal is constantly being updated with new features and bug fixes. Updating will be different depending on the installation type:
      
- For installation packages, uninstall the previous version (uninstall.exe for Windows, delete the Application folder on MacOS); then, download the latest version and reinstall. User settings and data will remain.
- For a `pip` installation, when a new version is published: `pip install openbb --upgrade`
- Upgrade the `pip installation` to the source code installation with:
  
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge git
git clone https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal.git
cd OpenBBTerminal
poetry install (for a complete installation - poetry install -E all)
```

The Terminal can now be launched with either, `openbb`, or, `python terminal.py`

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How can I give feedback about the OpenBB Terminal?</summary>
<p>

Being an open source platform that wishes to tailor to the needs of any type of investor, we highly encourage anyone to share with us their experience and/or how we can further improve the OpenBB Terminal. This can be anything from a very small bug, a new feature, or the implementation of a highly advanced Machine Learning model.

You are able to directly send us information about a bug or a question/suggestion from inside the terminal by using the `support` command which is available everywhere in the terminal. Here you can select which command you want to report a bug on, ask a question or make a suggestion. After entering `support`, when you press `ENTER` (‚èé), you are taken to the Support form which is automatically filled with your input. You are only required to include the type (e.g. bug, suggestion or question) and message in the form, although this can also be set directly from inside the terminal (see `support -h`).

<a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46355364/169503483-c93c83fa-e9e9-4345-b816-8fcfe02b6785.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46355364/169503483-c93c83fa-e9e9-4345-b816-8fcfe02b6785.png" alt="Support Command" width="800"/></a>

## Functionality

<details><summary>Why is data from today missing when I use the load function?</summary>
<p>

By default, the load function requests end-of-day daily data and is not included until the EOD summary has been published. The current day's data is considered intraday and is loaded when the `interval` argument is present.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Why does a specific menu or command not exist?</summary>
<p>

It could be that you are running an outdated version in which the menu or command is not yet available. Please check the [installation guide](https://docs.openbb.co/terminal/quickstart/installation) to download the most recent release.

Do note that it is also possible that the menu or command is removed. If this is undesirable, please reach out to us [here](https://openbb.co/support).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Why does my Portfolio file fail to load?</summary>
<p>

This will typically be the result of a formatting error. 

- Check that all the necessary column titles are present.
- Inspect the file to see if cells left blank have been filled unintentionally with 0 or NaN values.
- A particular asset may not be able to load data. Check for valid historical data from the Stocks menu.
- Format ticker symbols according to yFinance naming convention.
- All dates must be entered as YYYY-MM-DD.
- Transactions dated for today will fail to load historical data.
- MacOS users should attempt to avoid using the Numbers application as it has a habit of changing the formatting while saving.

## Source

<details><summary>How do I update the OpenBB Terminal?</summary>
<p>

A source code installation can utilize the `update` command from the main menu of the OpenBB Terminal, or, exit and enter:
      
```bash
git pull
```

If this fails due to the fact that you had modified some python files, and there's a conflict with the updates, you can use:

```bash
git stash
```

Then, re-run `poetry install` to get any new dependencies. Once installation is finished, you're ready to use the OpenBB Terminal again. If you `stashed` your changes previously, you can un-stash them with:

```bash
git stash pop
```

**NOTE:** When you close the terminal and re-open it, the only command you need to re-call is `conda activate obb`
before you call `openbb` again.

<details><summary>What kind of architectural pattern does the OpenBB SDK use?</summary>
<p>

Throughout the entire OpenBB Platform, the [Model-view-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) architectural pattern is used for creating functionality in the OpenBB Terminal.

The `model` relates to any calculations or data collection done. The `view` is meant for showing tables or graphs and the `controller` makes it possible to execute a command with a set of arguments directly in the OpenBB Terminal. Learn more about this in our [CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

<details><summary>Why do I get too many red error lines on Windows?</summary>
<p>

If you are on Windows and your terminal has too many red error lines, it is likely that this is the issue. Go to this page and install the 2019 Build Tools (not the latest) found [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_install/microsoft-visual-c-140/6f0726e2-6c32-4719-9fe5-aa68b5ad8e6d)

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>What does it mean if it says wheel is missing?</summary>
<p>

If you receive any notifications regarding `wheel` missing, this could be due to this dependency missing.

`conda install -c conda-forge wheel` or `pip install wheel`

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Why do these .whl files not exist?</summary>
<p>

If you get errors about .whl files not existing (usually on Windows) you have to reinitialize the following folder.
Just removing the 'artifacts' folder could also be enough:

| Platform | Location                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Linux    | "~/.cache/pypoetry"             |
| Mac      | "~/Library/Caches/pypoetry"     |
| Windows  | "%localappdata%/pypoetry/cache" |

When you try to add a package to Poetry it is possible that it causes a similar issue. Here you can remove the
'artifacts' folder again to reinitialize Poetry.

If you run into trouble with Poetry, and the advice above did not help, your best bet is to try

1. `poetry update --lock`

2. `conda deactivate` -> `conda activate obb`, then try again

3. Track down the offensive package and purge it from your anaconda `<environment_name>` folder, then try again
   (removing through conda can sometimes leave locks behind)

   | Platform  | Location                                     |
   | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
   | Linux/Mac | "~/anaconda3/envs" or "~/opt/anaconda3/envs" |
   | Windows   | "%userprofile%/anaconda3/envs"               |

4. Completely nuke your conda environment folder and make a new environment from scratch

- `conda deactivate`
- `conda env remove -n obb`
- `conda clean -a`
- Make a new environment and install dependencies again.

5. Reboot your computer and try again

6. Submit a ticket on GitHub

<details><summary>What does the JSONDecodeError mean during poetry install?</summary>
<p>

Sometimes poetry can throw a `JSONDecodeError` on random packages while running `poetry install`. This can be observed on macOS 10.14+ running python 3.8+. This is because of the use of an experimental installer that can be switched off to avoid the mentioned error. Run the code below as advised [here](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4210) and it should fix the installation process.

```bash
poetry config experimental.new-installer false
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Why do a receive a ModuleNotFoundError?</summary>
<p>

IF you receive an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_______'`

<p>Before you start begin troubleshooting please verify that you have followed the recommended installation instructions.
These errors often can occur when you have not activated the virtual environment where you have installed the terminal, or you have not used the `poetry install` command to install the dependencies.</p>

If you are still having issues install the missing packages via pip. For example if you get the error that `yfinance` is not found, you would run `pip install yfinance`

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How do I fix "Cannot convert a symbolic Tensor..."?</summary>
<p>

If you run into issues installing or `Cannot convert a symbolic Tensor...` at runtime, try this:

```bash
poetry install
poetry install -E prediction
```

_Commands that may help you in case of an error:_

- `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- `poetry update --lock`
- `poetry install`

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How do I deal with errors regarding CRLF?</summary>
<p>

When trying to commit code changes, pylint will prevent you from doing so if your line break settings are set to
CRLF (default for Windows).
This is because the entire package uses LF (default for Linux/Mac), and it is therefore
important that you change this setting to LF _before_ you make any changes to the code.

It is possible that CRLF automatically turns back on, you can correct this with:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

In case you already made coding adjustments, you have to reset your cache, and the changes you made to the code with
the following:

```bash
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Why can't I run OpenBB via the VS Code integrated terminal?</summary>
<p>

This occurs when VS Code terminal python version/path is different from the terminal version.

To fix it add this to vscode JSON settings ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54582361/vscode-terminal-shows-incorrect-python-version-and-path-launching-terminal-from)):

```bash
    "terminal.integrated.inheritEnv": false,
```
