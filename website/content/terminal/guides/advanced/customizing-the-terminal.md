To adjust the lay-out and settings of the OpenBB Terminal you can access the `settings` menu. This menu allows you to
tweak how the terminal behaves. This includes the following:

- `dt` adds or removes the datetime from the flair (which is next to the emoji).
- `flair` allows you to change the emoji that is used.
- `lang` gives the ability to change the terminal language. At this moment, the terminal is only available in English.
- `export` defines the folder you wish to export data you acquire from the terminal. Use quotes for custom locations.
- `tz` allows you to change the timezone if this is incorrectly displayed for you.
- `autoscaling` automatically scales plots for you if enabled (when green).
- `pheight` sets the percentage height of the plot (graphs) displayed (if autoscaling is enabled).
- `pwidth` sets the percentage width of the plot (graphs) displayed (if autoscaling is enabled).
- `height` sets the height of the plot (graphs) displayed (if autoscaling is disabled).
- `width` sets the width of the plot (graphs) displayed (if autoscaling is disabled).
- `dpi` refers to the resolution that is used for the plot (graphs)
- `backend` allows you to change the backend that is used for the graphs
- `monitor` choose which monitors to scale the plot (graphs) to if applicable
