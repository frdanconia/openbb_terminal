RISK FACTORS:
We may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies, and when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement.

These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed.

The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities.

For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“ TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.

Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals'actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability.

These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.

We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers.

An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control.

If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS:

Highlights from the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 included: 31 PART I Item 2 Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models.

Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.

Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively.

Gross margin increased $5.5 billion or 21% driven by growth across each of our segments.

Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.

More Personal Computing Revenue increased $1.5 billion or 12%.

Operating expenses increased $1.2 billion or 11% driven by investments in cloud engineering, Gaming, and commercial sales.

INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate was 0% and 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 4%, respectively.

Cost of revenue increased $2.6 billion or 24% driven by growth in Microsoft Cloud and Gaming.

The acquisition has been approved by Nuance’ s shareholders, and we expect it to close by the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

36 PART I Item 2 Intelligent Cloud Revenue increased $4.0 billion or 31%.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties.

Key changes in operating expenses were: Operating income increased $4.4 billion or 27% driven by growth across each of our segments.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U. S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U. S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U. S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.
