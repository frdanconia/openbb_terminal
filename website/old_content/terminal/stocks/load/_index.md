Load a symbol to perform analysis using the string above as a template. Optional arguments and their descriptions are listed below.

The default source is, yFinance (<https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/>). Alternatively, one may select either AlphaVantage (<https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/>) or IEX Cloud (<https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/>) as the data source for the analysis. Please note that certain analytical features are exclusive to the source.

To load a symbol from an exchange outside of the NYSE/NASDAQ default, use yFinance as the source and add the corresponding exchange to the end of the symbol. i.e. 'BNS.TO'.

BNS is a dual-listed stock, there are separate options chains and order books for each listing. Opportunities for arbitrage may arise from momentary pricing discrepancies between listings with a dynamic exchange rate as a second order opportunity in ForEx spreads.

Certain analytical features, such as VWAP, require the ticker to be loaded as intraday using the '-i x' argument. When encountering this error, simply reload the symbol using the interval argument. i.e. 'load -t BNS -s YYYY-MM-DD -i 1 -p' loads one-minute intervals, including Pre/After Market data, using the default source, yFinance.

Certain features, such as the Prediction menu, require the symbol to be loaded as daily and not intraday.
