# Degiro

This menu aims to contain several commands that are available to a user through his Degiro account.

In order to be able to use these, just ensure you connect to your degiro account by typing `login` first.

## Credentials

In order to login you need to update [config file](/openbb_terminal/config_terminal.py) with the following credentials:

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| DG_USERNAME | Username used to log into Degiro's website. |
| DG_PASSWORD | Password used to log into Degiro's website. |

This can either be done manually or through the `keys` menu.

## 2FA

In order to use 2FA you need to update [config file](/openbb_terminal/config_terminal.py).

We provide 2 alternatives:

1. Manually typing the `OneTimePassword` each time you login. To do this, after setting your credentials as explained above, go to sub-menu `portfolio/bro/degiro` and type `login -otp OneTimePassword`. `OneTimePassword` is the secret key generated by your authenticator.

2. Automatically generate your `OneTimePassword`. No need to manually input it again.

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| DG_TOTP_SECRET | This secret key will let OpenBB terminal generate the `OneTimePassword` for you. |

If you provide your `DG_TOTP_SECRET`, you won't have to type your `OneTimePassword`, OpenBB terminal will generate it for you
at each connection.

`DG_TOTP_SECRET` is the text representation of the `QRCODE` that Degiro's provide you when you enable 2FA.

More information on 2FA credentials, in the documentation of the [degiro-connector library](https://github.com/Chavithra/degiro-connector).
