A broker is a person or company who works as a go-between for an investor and a securities exchange. Individual traders and investors require the services of exchange members since securities exchanges only accept orders from persons or organizations that are members of the exchange.

Brokers provide that service and are paid in a variety of methods, including commissions, fees, and payments from the exchange itself. Investopedia examines all of the top brokers on a regular basis and keeps a list of the finest online brokers and trading platforms to assist investors in determining which broker is right for them.
