usage: kurtosis [-l N_LENGTH] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h]
```
Kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. Like skewness, kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different measures of kurtosis may have different interpretations.

Kurtosis identifies where the volatility risk came from in a distribution of returns. Kurtosis improves oneâ€™s understanding of volatility risk.

Kurtosis is also known as the fourth moment of the distribution, used in conjunction with mean, standard deviation, and skewness to understand the shape of a distribution of returns. In its base case, kurtosis has a neutral value of 3.0. The calculation is frequently modified by the second term in the equation below, which scales kurtosis so that the baseline, neutral value is 0.0.
