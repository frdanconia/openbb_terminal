    Is CeFi any safer than DeFi?
BitMart,  the self-proclaimed “
Most Trusted Crypto Trading Platform
”, has lost ~$196M from two of its hot wallets on Ethereum and BSC.
The stolen assets 
(mostly memecoins) total ~$100M on Ethereum and ~$96M on BSC.
As news began to 
circulate,  BitMart Telegram admins dismissed rumours as “
fake news
”, while stating that requests about the possible hack were creating “
unnecessary tension
”.
Eventually, BitMart CEO Sheldon Xia 
announced that the withdrawals had in fact been down to a “
security breach
”, going on to inform users that “
At this moment we are temporarily suspending withdrawals until further notice.
”
However, Xia put the total loss at $150M, despite the fact that total losses were already known to be 
~$196M,  a figure that BitMart continues to use in its official 
statement.
	
CEXs are supposed to provide their users with trust.
Just two days ago, 
Celsius also 
lost $50M from a hot wallet in the 
BadgerDAO front-end attack, also 
downplaying the loss.
With this latest “
security breach
” sending BitMart straight to number 2 on our 
leaderboard,  one obvious question springs to mind.
If CeFi isn’t any safer, why use it?
The attack began on Ethereum with 
this transaction at 21:31:09 +UTC for ~$33M of SHIB, commencing on BSC around half an hour 
later with ~$41M SAFEMOON.
On Ethereum, the affected wallet, labelled 
Bitmart 2,  was drained of the majority of its contents. The only substantial remaining asset balance is ~$40M of BitMart’s own 
token,  presumably because of the difficulty unloading it outside of the exchange.
The affected wallet on BSC: 
0x8c128dba2cb66399341aa877315be1054be75da8
Breakdown of losses by token on Ethereum (~$100M).
Breakdown of losses by token on BSC (~$96M).
The hacker transferred BitMart user funds from the hot wallets to the following addresses:
Ethereum 1: 
0x39fb0dcd13945b835d47410ae0de7181d3edf270
Ethereum 2: 
0x4bb7d80282f5e0616705d7f832acfc59f89f7091
BSC: 
0x25fb126b6c6b5c8ef732b86822fa0f0024e16c61
From there, the various memecoins were swapped via 1inch to ETH and BNB before being washed via TornadoCash.
BitMart is still investigating what caused the security breach, and has yet to comment on any reimbursement for affected users.
The 
Security section of their website states that <0.5% of their assets are kept in hot wallets.
This puts BitMart’s total assets at over $39 billion…
If that figure is really true, then a full refund for affected users should be no problem.
Centralised platforms exist as a trusted go-between for those who may have reservations about interacting directly with crypto.
Users give up custody of their assets with the expectation that the people managing them are experts in security and best practise.
It remains to be seen how the attacker managed to gain access to the wallets in question.
Hopefully it wasn’t another basic OPSEC error such as granting unlimited approvals to an EOA, as in Celsius’ case.
These are understandable mistakes when it comes to individuals and smaller balances. But at this level it’s hard to forgive, especially when CeFi represents the corrupt legacy financial system cashing in on the innovation of DeFi.
A Cayman-registered corporation has lost close to $200M. Their communications team first denied and then downplayed the losses. All this while freezing withdrawals until out of the news cycle, when the fear of a “bank run” has subsided.
Do these middlemen deserve to take a profit?
And if they insist on doing so, will BitMart at least commit to refunding their users?
