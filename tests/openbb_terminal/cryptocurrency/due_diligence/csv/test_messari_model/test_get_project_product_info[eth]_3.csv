0,The DAO Hack,2016-06-01 04:00:00+00:00,Hack,"An attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO smart contracts, allowing the guilty party to steal 3.6 million ETH. A significant portion of the Ethereum community opted to reverse the transactions via a hard fork to recover the funds. However, a few stakeholders did not approve of a chain reversal, leading to a contentious hard fork. The legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history is now known as Ethereum Classic (a href=""https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic""$ETC/a)."
1,Transaction spam attack,2016-09-22 04:00:00+00:00,DDoS Attack,"In Sep. 2016, just a few months after the DAO Hack and subsequent hard fork, Ethereum experienced a computational DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack in which the assailant(s) spammed the network by calling the EXTCODESIZE opcode roughly 50,000 times per block. The attack reduced the rate of block production by 50-66% as block validation times ballooned to 20-60 seconds (as opposed to 12-14 seconds).

In response, Ethereum developers opted to initiate a hard fork at block 2463000 (Oct. 18, 2016) to implement EIP-150, which addressed the issue of underpriced operation codes to make future DDoS attacks cost-prohibitive. The Ethereum team initially proposed issuing a second hard fork upgrade to introduce EIP-158. But they later decided to replace it with EIP-161, which they included in the Spurious Dragon hard fork."
