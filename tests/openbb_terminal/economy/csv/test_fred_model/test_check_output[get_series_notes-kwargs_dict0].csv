information on X-13ARIMA-SEATS can be found here (https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/).  Many
series include both seasonally adjusted (SA) and not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data. Occasionally,
updates to the data will not include sufficient seasonal factors to trigger a seasonal adjustment.
In these cases, the NSA series will be updated normally; but the SA series will also be updated with
the NSA data. The NSA series can be located here here
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU36935615552000001).  Some seasonally adjusted series may
exhibit negative values because they are created from a seasonal adjustment process regardless of
the actual meaning or interpretation of the given indicator.""  New York City, NY constitutes a
