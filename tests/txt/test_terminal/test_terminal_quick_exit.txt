Welcome to OpenBB Terminal 1.0

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

The main commands you should be aware when navigating through the terminal are:
    cls      clear the screen
    h / ?    help menu
    q / ..   quit this menu and go one menu above
    exit     exit the terminal
    r        reset the terminal and reload configs from the current location
    cd       jump into a menu in an absolute way (e.g. if in crypto I can do 'cd stocks/disc/')

Multiple jobs queue (where each '/' denotes a new command). E.g.
    /stocks $ disc/ugs -n 3/../load tsla/candle

The previous logic also holds for when launching the terminal. E.g.
    python terminal.py /stocks/disc/ugs -n 3/../load tsla/candle

Quick exit enabled
